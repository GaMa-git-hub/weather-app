# 🌦️ Weather App (Python)

This project is a beginner-friendly Python Weather App that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It includes two versions:

- ✅ **Version 1**: CLI-based weather checker
- ✅ **Version 2**: GUI-based weather dashboard using Tkinter

Users can input a city name and receive current weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and a short description (e.g., "clear sky", "rain", etc.).

This project demonstrates how to:
- Work with REST APIs in Python
- Parse and display JSON responses
- Build both command-line and graphical interfaces
